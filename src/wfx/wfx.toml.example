# Primeagent Service Configuration
#
# This file tells WFX to use Primeagent's full-featured service implementations
# instead of the minimal/noop services built into WFX.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to your PRIMEAGENT_CONFIG_DIR as wfx.toml
#   2. Or add to pyproject.toml under [tool.wfx.services]
#
# The services will be automatically discovered and loaded when you run:
#   - primeagent run
#   - wfx serve (when run from primeagent project)

[services]
# Core Services - Full-featured Primeagent implementations
database_service = "primeagent.services.database.service:DatabaseService"
storage_service = "primeagent.services.storage.local:LocalStorageService"
cache_service = "primeagent.services.cache.service:ThreadingInMemoryCache"

# Authentication & Session Management
auth_service = "primeagent.services.auth.service:AuthService"
session_service = "primeagent.services.session.service:SessionService"

# Chat & Communication
chat_service = "primeagent.services.chat.service:ChatService"

# State & Data Management
state_service = "primeagent.services.state.service:StateService"
variable_service = "primeagent.services.variable.service:VariableService"

# Background Processing
task_service = "primeagent.services.task.service:TaskService"
job_queue_service = "primeagent.services.job_queue.service:JobQueueService"

# Marketplace & Components
store_service = "primeagent.services.store.service:StoreService"

# Observability
telemetry_service = "primeagent.services.telemetry.service:TelemetryService"
tracing_service = "primeagent.services.tracing.service:TracingService"

# Note: settings_service is NOT configurable - it always uses the built-in implementation
# Note: mcp_composer_service uses the wfx implementation by default
